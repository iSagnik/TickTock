# TickTock
Twine Game project for CSC 281

The game is about a person having a lucid dream about a dystopian time when he travels back to the remnants of earth. The game 
follows him around as he explores earth and makes crucial decisions. The aim is to avoid waking up for as long as you can. The game
becomes more and more 'weird' every step.

'Cheat Sheet'
The options that suggest anything remotely towards consciousness could lead to the character waking up. The choices to cause damage or 
movement have the potential to wake the character. The strategy is to keep exploring without much activity or exposure to the elements.
The game is inspired from a game I came across called 'The Button'
The game is not under any license and is free ot be used/reproduced in an y way seemed reasonable. I will not be liable for any legal/moral
implications of the use of this project or reproduction in any context beyond the scope of CSC 281 at NC State University.

Run the game on chrome. All the assets are included in the zip however it's hosted through a public github repo for access from anywhere.
